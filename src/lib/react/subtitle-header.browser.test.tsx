/**
 * The header reaches libass exactly as the file wrote it.
 *
 * The player used to rewrite two fields on its way in, `ScaledBorderAndShadow: no` and empty
 * `LayoutResX`/`LayoutResY`. Both were added in 2025 (8aa9e07 and 8c01612, a day apart) while every
 * event was still landing on libass's own default style, which draws a fatter outline and a drop
 * shadow the file never asked for; thinning the border was treating that. The style bug is fixed, so
 * the treatment goes, and the file gets to say how its own subtitles look.
 *
 * `public/subtitle-header.mkv` probes both fields in one frame. Neither of its two styles is called
 * Default, so an event resolving its style by anything but the right index lands on the wrong one and
 * shows. Both carry a fat outline in a bright colour so the border is measurable, and the lower line
 * adds a blur:
 *
 *   ScaledBorderAndShadow  scales Outline with the script, so it moves the PLAIN line's box
 *   LayoutResX/Y           scales blur radii, so it moves the GROWTH from the plain box to the blurred one
 *
 * The border reference is ffmpeg's own libass on that same track, per half of a 1920x1080 frame:
 *
 *   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i color=black:size=1920x1080 \
 *          -vf "ass=subtitle-header.ass,crop=1920:540:0:0,bbox=min_val=16" -frames:v 1 -f null -
 *   -> top 357x60
 *
 * The BLUR reference is not ffmpeg's, deliberately. The two libass builds agree on geometry to the
 * pixel but not on how far a blur spreads: at the same blur scale ffmpeg grows the box by 39px where
 * jassub's build grows it by 23. So the blur figure below is this build's own, pinned as a regression
 * guard rather than a cross-engine one. That it is a real probe of LayoutRes was established by
 * measuring a second fixture identical but for LayoutRes 3840x2160, a blur scale of 0.5 instead of
 * 1.5: the growth fell from 23px to 7px, a ratio of 0.30 against ffmpeg's 0.33 on the same pair, and
 * the plain line did not move at all. Clearing LayoutRes drops the scale to 1.0 and the growth with it.
